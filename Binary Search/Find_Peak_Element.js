/*
A peak element is an element that is strictly greater than its neighbors.
Given a 0-indexed integer array nums, find a peak element, and return its index. If the array contains multiple peaks, return the index to any of the peaks.
You may imagine that nums[-1] = nums[n] = -âˆž. In other words, an element is always considered to be strictly greater than a neighbor that is outside the array.
You must write an algorithm that runs in O(log n) time.

 
Example 1:

Input: nums = [1,2,3,1]
Output: 2
Explanation: 3 is a peak element and your function should return the index number 2.

  // assuming it has just 1 peak

    else if (nums[mid] > nums[mid + 1]) {
      high = mid - 1;

    // to avoid infinite loop from [1,5,1,2,1], as (1 is not greater than 5 or 2)
    //just go right or left , doesn't matter
